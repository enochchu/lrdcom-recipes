On Screen Helper
======

In order to use on screen helper all you need to do is add the class "on-screen-helper" to whatever element you desire. Then, when the element reaches the bottom of the visible screen the class "on-screen-bottom" will be added. When the element reaches the top of the screen the class "on-screen-top" will be added. After the element has completely left the visible screen both classes will be removed. You can set the data-offset-top or data-offset-bottom to make the action happen at a certain number of pixels from the top or bottom. For example data-offset-bottom="200" will add the class when the element reaches 200px above the bottom of the screen. The data-offset-repeat-bottom/data-offset-repeat-top attribute can also be set to "true" and then the class will be added and removed each time the element enters the visible screen area, if the data-offset-repeat is left out, by default the class will only be added once.

On screen helper allows you to add animations or transitions to elements which are triggered each time they enter the screen. You could add a css transition on .on-screen-bottom and then each time it entered the screen that transition would occur. This function can also be used for a paralax scrolling effect. Using the .on-screen-top class you could change a div to position:fixed when it reaches the top of the screen, resulting in the allusion of paralax scrolling.
